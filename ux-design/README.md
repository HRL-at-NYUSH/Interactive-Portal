## UX Design

1. You can view the clickable prototype [here](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/632d8c3).

The prototype includes both old and new versions of the wireframes. The final version of the wireframes ends with the slide named [end](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/632d8c3/screen/80168868).

2. In the [ux-design](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/tree/main/ux-design)  folder, you can view the individual wireframes (used in the prototype) in the file named [portal-wireframes.pdf](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/tree/main/ux-design/portal-wireframes.pdf).

3. You can view and edit wireframes on the draw.io website [here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1r1msHg7VZ971lZnvIo_0tSoqD1FM_E1l) and [here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1TIWTO3uz7qCdaP8uLbQi3V-WYXaf5yEc). 

For now, only Professor, Sarah, Tim and Alma have edit access to the wireframes - let us know if you would like to edit them. 

4. In the [archived](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/tree/main/ux-design/archived) folder, you can view the old version of the wireframes.
