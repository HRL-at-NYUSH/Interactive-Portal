## UX Design

1. You can view the clickable prototype [here](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/632d8c3) 

The prototype includes both old and new versions. The final version of the prototype ends with the slide named 'End' [here](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/632d8c3/screen/80168868) 

2. In the [ux-design](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/tree/main/ux-design)  folder, you can view the individual wireframes (used in the prototype) in the pdf file called [portal-wireframes.pdf']().

3. You can view and edit raw wireframes on the draw.io website [here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1r1msHg7VZ971lZnvIo_0tSoqD1FM_E1l)  and [here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1TIWTO3uz7qCdaP8uLbQi3V-WYXaf5yEc). 

For now, Sarah, Tim and Alma have access to the wireframes - let us know if you would like to / need to edit them. 

4. In the [archived](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/tree/main/ux-design/archived) folder, you can view the old version of the wireframes
