## Front-end notes

## Week 1:

Welcome to the HRL Interactive Portal team! You are contributing to a high impact project with potentially hundreds of users from NYU Shanghai community and beyond! This will look great on your CV ^-^ Good luck!

View git workflow recorded tutorial, install React and complete the exercise. For troubleshooting, reach out to Alma or Sarah.

## Week 2:

**Mock JS data**

Mock JS data is uploaded in the [utils](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHZWErUzf4Va2pIp-jfaT0APpLI42g3VxjmACjSkuPjB2OMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) folder - you can start playing with the data!
There are two files: MockNonGeo.js and MockGeo.js. <br/>
MockNonGeo.js contains data without geospatial information (no latitude, longitude info) and MockGeo.js contains geospatial information.

To view a sample React file that includes components and imports the data, take a look at the SampleDataUse.js file and visit the SampleDataUse route (you can find it on the [menu panel](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/blob/main/front-end/images/menu.png) of the React app). On the SampleDataUse page, you should see the an example of using geospatial and nongeospatial mock data (using the same component):
<img src="https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/blob/main/front-end/images/main.png"/>
<br/><br/>
Firstly, to import the data, include the following lines in your javascript file:

const { dataNonGeo } = require('../utils/MockNonGeo.js')

const { dataGeo } = require('../utils/MockGeo.js')

Then, you can call/modify the data inside your component. One particular use of the mock data is provided in the DataDisplay component - selected key-value pairs (from MockGeo.js and MockNonGeo.js files) are displayed using the map function.
