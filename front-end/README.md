# Front-end notes

## Week 1:

Welcome to the HRL Interactive Portal team! You are contributing to a high impact project with potentially hundreds of users from NYU Shanghai community and beyond! This will look great on your CV ^-^ Good luck!

View git workflow recorded tutorial, install React and complete the exercise. For troubleshooting, reach out to Alma or Sarah.

## Week 2:

**Mock JS data**

Mock JS data is uploaded in the [utils](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHZWErUzf4Va2pIp-jfaT0APpLI42g3VxjmACjSkuPjB2OMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) folder - you can start playing with the data!
There are two files: MockNonGeo.js and MockGeo.js. <br/>
MockNonGeo.js contains data without geospatial information (no latitude, longitude info) and MockGeo.js contains geospatial information.

To view a sample React file that includes components and imports the data, take a look at the SampleDataUse.js file and visit the SampleDataUse route (you can find it on the [menu panel](https://github.com/HRL-at-NYUSH/Interactive-Portal/blob/main/front-end/images/menu.png) of the React app). On the SampleDataUse page, you should see the an example of using geospatial and nongeospatial mock data (using the same component):

![mock data page](./images/main.png)

Firstly, to import the data, include the following lines in your javascript file:

const { dataNonGeo } = require('../utils/MockNonGeo.js')

const { dataGeo } = require('../utils/MockGeo.js')

Then, you can call/modify the data inside your component. One particular use of the mock data is provided in the DataDisplay component - selected key-value pairs (from MockGeo.js and MockNonGeo.js files) are displayed using the map function.

## Week 3

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework made up of [**utility classes**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first), which is more lower-level than frameworks like Bootstrap. Let's take a look at an example:

![Tailwind Example](./images/tailwind-example.png)

To build custmized component, we no longer need to specify the styles in a separate css file, but instead declare them in the **classes** of HTML elements.

In the example above, the class `p-6` means `padding: 1.5rem;`, `text-gray-500` means `color: rgba(107, 114, 128, var(--tw-text-opacity));`, and all the other definitions can be found in the [documentation page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

#### Code with Tailwind CSS easily

There are extensions/plugins for text editors to help you code Tailwind CSS more easily. If you are using VSCode, [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) is a great extension that provides **autocompletion** and **hover preview**.

#### Other Notes

[Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) is straightforward. You can add prefix to Tailwind classes to specify different screen size. Tailwind CSS is **mobile first** in that de unprefixed classes will be applied to the screen sizes **smaller** than the **smallest** specified prefix. For example:

```html
<!-- Width of 16 by default, 32 on medium screens, and 48 on large screens -->
<img class="w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48" src="..." />
```
