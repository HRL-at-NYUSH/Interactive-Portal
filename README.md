```

To start the react-app: <br>

```
- npm start
```

- Before starting the back-end server, navigate within the project folder in a different terminal and change the directory to back-end by doing the following command: <br>

```
- cd back-end
```

### Dependencies

To view the list of front-end dependencies, please refer to the file [here](front-end/package.json) and [here](front-end/README.md).

To view the list of front-end dependencies, please refer to the file [here](back-end/package.json).

A more detailed documentation of the react and express dependencies will be provided at the end of the project.

### MongoDB Connection Setup

All members of the Interactive Portal were invited to access the MongoDb Atlas Database Cluster for Humanities Research Lab.
To set up your account, please complete the following steps:

1. Accept invite in your email to access the HRL MongoDb Cluster
2. Sign up to MongoDb if you haven't yet (use your google nyu email).
3. Go to the **Database Access** tab and click on **Add a new database user** and register a new user - select a username and password and remember them for the future use. View the gif with instructions below.<br>
   ![MongoDB instructions](front-end/images/mongodb.gif)

4. Go to the [back-end](back-end) directory and create a file called .env. In that file, please include the following two lines with these changes - replace _your_username_ with your username (e.g. alma) from step 3 and _your_password_ with your password (e.g. asads123) from step 3. Refer to an example file [here](back-end/.env-example). Note that your file should be called _.env_

```
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### MongoDB Data Upload

1. Convert data from csv to json using the open source projects as [this one](https://csvjson.com/csv2json). The mock data which is currently uploaded to the database is available in csv format [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KWH-BrgNkeRjoB60bMJh1dfcQ_HHSIWIOPR8jO6rRCg/edit#gid=1479728107) and json format [here](front-end/src/js/utils/raw).
2. Install MongoDB server (Community version) following the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
3. To check if the MongoDB server is installed, please type the following command in the terminal:

```
mongo --version
```

You should see a version information. Otherwise, please try to reinstall MongoDB server.

4. In the MongoDB Atlas, go to the Cluster 0 and click on the primary cluster. In the newly opened tab, copy the name of the primary cluster, for example, _cluster0-shard-00-02.cc5yp.mongodb.net:27017_

5. Now go to the terminal and import your json file to the HRL Cluster. Please type the following command in the terminal:

```
mongoimport --host cluster_name --db new_database --type json --file ./myfile.json --jsonArray --authenticationDatabase admin --ssl --username your_username --password your_password
```

You should replace the following items in the command above:

- **cluster_name** is the name of the primary cluster that you retrieved in step 4. For example, _cluster0-shard-00-02.cc5yp.mongodb.net:27017_
- **new_database** is the name of the database where you would like to upload your data. You can view existing databases by clicking on your cluster (Cluster 0 for this project).
- **./myfile.json** is the path to the json file that you would like to upload to the database.
- **your_username** is your MongoDB username for the working cluster (from step 3 in the _MongoDB Connection Setup_ section above).
- **your_password** is your MongoDB password for the working cluster (from step 3 in the _MongoDB Connection Setup_ section above).

6. To view the newly uploaded data, in the MongoDB Atlas, go to your Cluster (Cluster 0) and click on _Collections_ - here you will be able to see the datasets. View the gif with instructions below.

### Postman Setup

- Postman is a desktop app that allows you to trigger custom HTTP requests to your local development web server, which relieves you from having to write (and debug) front-end code while your focus is on perfecting the back-end.
- To set up a postman application download it [here](https://web.postman.co/home)
- Once installed, get started by clicking the Create a request link on the Launchpad screen. Enter a route you have set up in express, such as http://localhost:3000/, and click the Send button.
- It is possible to save requests you want to run frequently so you can quickly test them as you work on the code.
- You can find a file called [express-js-starter-app.postman_collection.json](/back-end/utils/express-js-starter-app.postman_collection.json) that can be imported into Postman to easily try out all these routes.
- The list of routes that you can test are in the [back-end folder](back-end/). For a more detailed explanation on the routes, please see the video tutorial on back-end routes below.
